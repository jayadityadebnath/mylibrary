My mum climbed up a few spikes and she said \"Up\", and then the bricks built up by themselves, and then our heads were touching the ceiling! After that I wanted to get out so I jumped down the spikes. When my feet touched the ground I felt half happy and half angry. When my parents got down they pulled my shorts, and then they saw a large cut down my knee to my feet. Suddenly something broke our wall and came into our house when it screeched to a halt I got a better look at the person inside. I realized it was my friend, Kai, who is a super-powered fire ninja. He asked me if I wanted to go to our Ninja laboratory (it's where we make dangerous poisons such as metabolism which makes you say the truth even if you want to tell lies.) I said sure, only if you've brought some tiny vials of medical potion such as Terblo (Terblo stops the blood from coming out, and if you drink it, after half an hour it gives you a shock and then it makes your skin cover the area of the wound). He said of course, actually I have a huge vial of Terblo. Alright I said jus-ju-just put it on, Kai put it on and then I felt a strange sizzle in my skin (it was like there was fire on my skin you know). Just a minute after I felt the strange sizzle, something stomped hardly on the creaky floorboards, every thing was still and cold as well. it held a arrow made of obsidian and on the right was a knife made of wood I looked back and saw someones face I could not recgnise. When it turned around it's face looked like no other, but then the fearless Ninjas stepped up to the challange they punched and kept on kicking and kicking and kicking but it was up to no use the Ninjas only made it angrier and angrier and angrier. Kai started to use his fire power against it's ice power after that I tried to help him with my lightening powers only then the monster started to sqeal and scream.Finally the monster thrashed down to the floor and landed with a big loud thump!!                  </p> <pre><code>                            Moral:Teamwork makes the dreamwork\n</code></pre>"}]}
