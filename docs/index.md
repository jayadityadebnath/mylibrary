## The Pyramid

My mum and my dad were standing on a pyramid made out of Lego bricks, and what I could make out of it was that he was looking for something on top of it.
My mum climbed up a few spikes and said up and then the bricks built up themselves, and then our heads were touching the ceiling! After that  
I wanted to get out so I jumped down the spikes. When my feet touched the ground I felt half happy and half angry.
